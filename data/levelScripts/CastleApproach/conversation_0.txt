I can't see the light of the World Prism...
What has become of my home?
Newt Sad 1
The World Prism hasn't shone in many years...
Kit Sad 2
But it used to cover the entire kingdom in light!
It made everything brighter, warmer, more colorful!
Newt Sad 5
The Luminous Keep has been abandoned for years...
The darkness is all the comes from the Keep nowadays.
It creeps farther from the Keep every year.
Eventually it will destroy the forest.
and my home...
